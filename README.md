Thanks for looking at JPokemon!

### What the nuts is this?
I started rewriting Pokemon  in Java as a programming exercise. Early attempts were command line based, with little in common with the actual game. As I reworkd and reworked the code, the scope grew. This repository is a fully-fledged attempt at the game, with some of my own changes.


### I can already use a GameBoy Emulator
That's right, you can. But then, you would be missing out on some awesome features...

* Stat Point system  
  Training a Pokemon up from a low level pays off!
* Multiplayer  
  Oh, did I forget to say that?
* PvP... vPvPvP...  
  Multiplayer battles of any size.


### Overarching goals
Here are some goals I have for the project.

* Private Server play  
  LAN gaming night with Pokemon - or localhost your own private world. Private servers should be easy to set up, and allow for configuration. Pokemon can learn 10 moves at a time? You got it. Only hold 3 Pokemon in your party? No problem.
* Organic and Accessible code base  
  As much as possible will be written by my friends and I. No boilerplate frameworks, where it can be helped.  
  I started this project as a learning experience. As such, it should continue to be one. Code should be easy to understand, and pick up.

### Want to get involved?
No problem! Follow the repo, start talking! If the commits are rolling in, then I'm still in active development.
