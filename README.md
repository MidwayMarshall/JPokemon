Thanks for looking at JPokemon!

EDIT: [This project has moved!](#this-project-has-moved)

### What the nuts is this?
I started rewriting Pokemon in Java as a programming exercise. Early attempts were command line based, with little in common with the actual game. As I reworked and reworked the code, the scope grew. This repository is a fully-fledged attempt at the game, with some of my own changes.


### I can already use a GameBoy Emulator
That's right, you can. But then, you would be missing out on some awesome features...

* Stat Point system  
  Training a Pokemon up from a low level pays off!
* Multiplayer  
  Oh, did I forget to say that?
* PvP... vPvPvP...  
  Multiplayer battles of any size.


### Overarching goals
Here are some goals I have for the project.

* Private Server play  
  LAN gaming night with Pokemon - or localhost your own private world. Private servers should be easy to set up, and allow for configuration. Pokemon can learn 10 moves at a time? You got it. Only hold 3 Pokemon in your party? No problem.
* Organic and Accessible code base  
  As much as possible will be written by my friends and I. No boilerplate frameworks, where it can be helped.  
  I started this project as a learning experience. As such, it should continue to be one. Code should be easy to understand, and pick up.

### This Project Has Moved

I haven't committed anything in about 6 months, because I have moved my attention to the [JPokemon github group](https://github.com/jpokemon). There are several reasons I made this decision, which I will outline below. Long story short, you should check out my [current code base!](https://github.com/jpokemon/jpokemon)

1. This code is sloppy
2. These classes are missing fields
3. This code is not extensible by other people who only want part of it
4. I enjoy writing things the right way

This project won't compile and I have no intention of making it do so.

Please go see my current code.
